Load in libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read in data
```{r}
player_age <- read_csv("data/player_age.csv")
player_hw <- read_csv("data/player_height_weight.csv")
player_stats <- read_csv("data/player_stats.csv")
game_stats <- read_csv("data/game_stats.csv")
```

Lets do some data cleaning
First start with game_stats dataframe
```{r}
head(game_stats)

game_stats_clean <- game_stats %>%
  rename(week = "Week",
         date = "Date",
         over_time = "OT",
         attendance = "Attendance",
         score = "Score",
         diff = "Diff",
         total_goals = "Total",
         winner = "Winner",
         teams = "Final") %>%
  separate(teams, into = c('home_team', 'away_team'), sep = "@") %>%
  separate(score, into = c('home_score', 'away_score'), sep = "-") %>%
  #getting rid of the score at the end of the name in home_team
  mutate(across(home_team,
                ~str_replace_all(., "[0-9]+", ""))) %>%
  #same thing with away_team
  mutate(across(away_team,
                ~str_replace_all(., "[0-9]+", ""))) %>%
  #changing overtime to 1s and 0
  mutate(ot = case_when(over_time == "OT" ~1,
                          is.na(over_time) ~ 0)) %>%
  #now getting rid of the original over_time column
  select(!c(over_time))
```
